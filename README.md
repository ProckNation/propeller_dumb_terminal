# propeller_dumb_terminal
A Parallax Propeller based serial dumb terminal with some extra features.  The dumb terminal will include a VGA signal output and PS/2 keyboard and mouse inputs.  I might also include a buzzer for the terminal bell fuction.  I might also add a few LEDs to show the status of the serial port and associated flow control data.

## First update.  02-26-2015
One of the extra features is a mode that will take all the incomming text from the serial port and display it on the VGA output just as a serial based LCD module.  It will have a few special modes close to the same as a LCD would have.  Below is a list of modes that I can think of that I would like to include:
* No cursor mode
* Blinking cursor
* Non-blinking cursor
* Clear screen function
* Set foreground and background colors
* and more feature modes will be added once I have finished writing the code.

That is all for now.
