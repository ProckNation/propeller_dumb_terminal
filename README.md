# propeller_dumb_terminal
A Parallax Propeller based serial dumb terminal with extra features.

## First update.  02-26-2015
One of the extra features is a mode that will take all the incomming text from the serial port and display it on the VGA output just as a serial based LCD module.  It will have a few special modes close to the same as a LCD would have.  Below is a list of modes that I can think of that I would like to include:
* No cursor mode
* Blinking cursor
* Non-blinking cursor
* Clear screen function
* Set foreground and background colors
* and more feature modes will be added once I have finished writing the code.

That is all for now.
